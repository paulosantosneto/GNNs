`Warning` This is my implementation of the article ['struc2vec: Learning Node Representations from Structural Identity'](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.03165.pdf). Therefore, it is not an official repository of it. Any code improvement recommendations are welcome.

**Complementary articles to struc2vec implemented**
